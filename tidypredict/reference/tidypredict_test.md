# tidypredict_test


Tests base predict function against tidypredict




## Description

Compares the results of predict() and tidypredict_to_column()
functions.





## Usage
```r
tidypredict_test(
  model,
  df = model$model,
  threshold = 1e-12,
  include_intervals = FALSE,
  max_rows = NULL,
  xg_df = NULL
)
```




## Arguments


Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
model | An R model or a list with a parsed model. It currently supports
lm(), glm() and randomForest() models.
df | A data frame that contains all of the needed fields to run the prediction.
It defaults to the "model" data frame object inside the model object.
threshold | The number that a given result difference, between predict() and
tidypredict_to_column() should not exceed. For continuous predictions, the default
value is 0.000000000001 (1e-12), and for categorical predictions, the default value is
0.
include_intervals | Switch to indicate if the prediction intervals should be
included in the test. It defaults to FALSE.
max_rows | The number of rows in the object passed in the df argument. Highly
recommended for large data sets.
xg_df | A xgb.DMatrix object, required only for XGBoost models. It defaults to
NULL
recommended for large data sets.






## Examples
```r

model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl * disp, offset = am, data = mtcars)
tidypredict_test(model)
```
