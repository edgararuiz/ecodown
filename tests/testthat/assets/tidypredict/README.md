The main goal of `tidypredict` is to enable running predictions inside
databases. It reads the model, extracts the components needed to
calculate the prediction, and then creates an R formula that can be
translated into SQL. In other words, it is able to parse a model such as
this one:

``` r
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
```

`tidypredict` can return a SQL statement that is ready to run inside the
database. Because it uses `dplyr`’s database interface, it works with
several databases back-ends, such as MS SQL:

``` r
tidypredict_sql(model, dbplyr::simulate_mssql())
```

    ## <SQL> 39.6862614802529 + (`wt` * -3.19097213898374) + (`cyl` * -1.5077949682598)

## Installation

Install `tidypredict` from CRAN using:

``` r
# install.packages("tidypredict")
```

Or install the **development version** using `devtools` as follows:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("tidymodels/tidypredict")
```

## Functions

`tidypredict` has only a few functions, and it is not expected that
number to grow much. The main focus at this time is to add more models
to support.

| Function                     | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tidypredict_fit()`          | Returns an R formula that calculates the prediction                            |
| `tidypredict_sql()`          | Returns a SQL query based on the formula from `tidypredict_fit()`              |
| `tidypredict_to_column()`    | Adds a new column using the formula from `tidypredict_fit()`                   |
| `tidypredict_test()`         | Tests `tidyverse` predictions against the model’s native `predict()` function  |
| `tidypredict_interval()`     | Same as `tidypredict_fit()` but for intervals (only works with `lm` and `glm`) |
| `tidypredict_sql_interval()` | Same as `tidypredict_sql()` but for intervals (only works with `lm` and `glm`) |
| `parse_model()`              | Creates a list spec based on the R model                                       |
| `as_parsed_model()`          | Prepares an object to be recognized as a parsed model                          |

## How it works

<img src="man/figures/howitworks.png">

Instead of translating directly to a SQL statement, `tidypredict`
creates an R formula. That formula can then be used inside `dplyr`. The
overall workflow would be as illustrated in the image above, and
described here:

1.  Fit the model using a base R model, or one from the packages listed
    in [Supported Models](#supported-models)
2.  `tidypredict` reads model, and creates a list object with the
    necessary components to run predictions
3.  `tidypredict` builds an R formula based on the list object
4.  `dplyr` evaluates the formula created by `tidypredict`
5.  `dplyr` translates the formula into a SQL statement, or any other
    interfaces.
6.  The database executes the SQL statement(s) created by `dplyr`

### Parsed model spec

`tidypredict` writes and reads a spec based on a model. Instead of
simply writing the R formula directly, splitting the spec from the
formula adds the following capabilities:

1.  No more saving models as `.rds` - Specifically for cases when the
    model needs to be used for predictions in a Shiny app.
2.  Beyond R models - Technically, anything that can write a proper
    spec, can be read into `tidypredict`. It also means, that the parsed
    model spec can become a good alternative to using *PMML.*

## Supported models

The following models are supported by `tidypredict`:

  - Linear Regression - `lm()`
  - Generalized Linear model - `glm()`
  - Random Forest models - `randomForest::randomForest()`
  - Random Forest models, via `ranger` - `ranger::ranger()`
  - MARS models - `earth::earth()`
  - XGBoost models - `xgboost::xgb.Booster.complete()`
  - Cubist models - `Cubist::cubist()`
  - Tree models, via `partykit` - `partykit::ctree()`

### `parsnip`

`tidypredict` supports models fitted via the `parsnip` interface. The
ones confirmed currently work in `tidypredict` are:

  - `lm()` - `parsnip`: `linear_reg()` with *“lm”* as the engine.
  - `randomForest::randomForest()` - `parsnip`: `rand_forest()` with
    *“randomForest”* as the engine.
  - `ranger::ranger()` - `parsnip`: `rand_forest()` with *“ranger”* as
    the engine.
  - `earth::earth()` - `parsnip`: `mars()` with *“earth”* as the engine.

### `broom`

The `tidy()` function from broom works with linear models parsed via
`tidypredict`

``` r
pm <- parse_model(lm(wt ~ ., mtcars))
tidy(pm)
```

    ## # A tibble: 11 x 2
    ##    term        estimate
